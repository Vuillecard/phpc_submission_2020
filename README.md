# PHPC - CONJUGATE GRADIENT PROJECT 2020  
  
**Pierre vuillecard CSE**  
  
The goal of this project is to implement a parallel version of the conjugate gradient  
solver of Ax=b. Two version has to be implemented which is separated into two file :  
- *CG-PHPC-MPI/* it contains all the code for the mpi version  
- *CG-PHPC-CUDA/* it contains all the code for the cuda version
